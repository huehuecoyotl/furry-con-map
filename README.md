# furry-con-map
The tool that used to create the JSON behind the furry convention map served at [https://coyo.tl/map](https://coyo.tl/map).

THIS TOOL HAS BEEN DEPRECATED. A new method of submitting data is currently being worked on -- I will be excited to link to it here when it's ready. In the meantime, please submit updates directly to kaiyoht, the owner of the website. Contact information available [here](https://coyo.tl/contact).
